//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
    let arrOfMovies = ["mov1", "mov2", "mov3"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
    let firstMovie = arrOfMovies[0]
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
    let arrLength = arrOfMovies.length
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
    let lastElement = arrOfMovies [ arrOfMovies.length - 1]
