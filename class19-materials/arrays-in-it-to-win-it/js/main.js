//Create an array of movies with at least three movies.
    let arrOfMovies = ["mov1", "mov2", "mov3"]
//Using the array from above, store the first movie in a variable
    let firstMovie 
//Get the length of the original array and store it in a new variable
    mov1 = arrMovies(array.length)
//Get the last element in that array and store it in a new variable. What if your array was really large and you didn't know the last index? Would your solution still work?
